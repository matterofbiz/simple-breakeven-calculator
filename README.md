Simple Break-even Calculator (Android app)

The basics of pricing should lead you to set up a price which in line with your costs allow you to make a profit.

Unit fixed costs decrease with your sales, while unit variable costs are constant with sales; so then, as sales increase turnover allows for covering the variable costs (whenever the selling price exceeds the unit variable cost) and part of the fixed costs. The break-even point is the level of sales when turnover will just cover both costs, leading the company to abandon loses.

The break-even point is the level of sales which is a minimum for the company to start making a profit. To obtain this in terms of units and currency, input the figures for your fixed costs, the variable cost and the unit price.

This calculator indicates you the number of units that allow your company or project to reach break-even, showing you the solution diagram, as well. Use it for simulating different scenarios of costs and prices.
